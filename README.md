# Ivy to mypyvy

[![CI](https://github.com/tchajed/ivy-to-mypyvy/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tchajed/ivy-to-mypyvy/actions/workflows/build.yml)

Convert an [Ivy](https://kenmcmil.github.io/ivy/) transition system (after its liveness-to-safety reduction) to a
[mypyvy](https://github.com/wilcoxjay/mypyvy) input file, as a first step towards applying invariant inference.
